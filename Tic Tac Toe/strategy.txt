Here, I have developed the following strategy apart from going for the win if the computer has a chance
and preventing the opponent from winning.
	1. Since the center of the board is crucial to winning, my first rule is that the computer has to occupy the 
	center of the board if playing first or first has to check if it is empty and then occupy it if playing second.
	2. Cover the corners randomly with one major exception: if the opponent has covered the diagonally opposite corners, I 		have specified a rule which tells agent to override covering the corner and randomly occupy any of the vacant inner	    	sides so that we lower the probability of losing.
	3. If the center and the corners have been occupied, then looked at the inner sides and randomly fill it or block
	the opponent if necessary.
